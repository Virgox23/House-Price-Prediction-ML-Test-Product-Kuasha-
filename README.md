# **Machine Learning Project-1**

## **Project Overview**
This project is a sample machine learning project developed as part of the **Machine Learning Professional Course** offered by **UNICORNS CODES** in collaboration with the **Bangladesh Hi-Tech Park Authority**. It serves as a hands-on learning experience to apply theoretical concepts to a real-world problem using Python, datasets from Kaggle, and tools like Google Colab and Visual Studio Code.

This is my **first full-fledged machine learning project**, and it marks a significant milestone in my journey to becoming a machine learning professional. The project demonstrates my ability to work with datasets, preprocess data, build and evaluate machine learning models, and structure code for reproducibility and presentation.




## **Project Details**

### **Objective**
The goal of this project is to:
1. Explore a dataset from Kaggle.
2. Perform data preprocessing and analysis.
3. Build and evaluate machine learning models.
4. Document the process and results for future reference and showcasing.




### **Tools and Technologies Used**
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Dataset Source**: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com)
- **Development Environment**: 
  - **Google Colab**: For running and structuring the code interactively.
  - **Visual Studio Code**: For final code organization and showcasing.
- **Libraries**: 
  - Data Manipulation: `pandas`, `numpy`
  - Visualization: `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
  - Machine Learning: `scikit-learn`
  - Model Evaluation: `mean_squared_error`, `r2_score`, etc.








## **Project Structure**
The project is organized as follows:

## **How to Run the Project**

### **Prerequisites**
1. Install Python (preferably version 3.8 or higher).
2. Install the required libraries using the `requirements.txt` file:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### **Steps**
1. **Download the Dataset**:
   - The dataset used in this project is available on Kaggle. Download it and place it in the `data/` folder.

2. **Run the Notebook or Open file section in Colab**:
   - Open the `main_notebook.ipynb` file in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.
   - Open a new notebook in Google Colab and upload data set in the files section.
   - Execute the cells step-by-step to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.

3. **Explore Mains**:
   - The `Main`&Main for Web Application folder contains modular Python scripts for preprocessing and model training. These can be run independently if needed.


4. **View Results**:
   - Check the `results/` folder for visualizations and model performance metrics.


## **Key Learnings**
This project helped me gain hands-on experience in:
- Loading and exploring datasets from Kaggle.
- Performing data cleaning and preprocessing.
- Building and evaluating machine learning models.
- Structuring code for reproducibility and presentation.
- Using Google Colab for interactive development and Visual Studio Code for final code organization.
